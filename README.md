Project from my Astrophysics Honors class from our solar energy unit!

This represents a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to simulate the random movement of a photon within a circular region.

The simulation employs a Monte Carlo method to simulate the random walk of the photon, generating random angles for each step and calculating 
the photon's path until it exits the specified radius (the radiative zone of the sun).

Python's math library is utilized to perform mathematical calculations, including trigonometric functions. 

The random library is used to generate random angles for the photons' steps.
